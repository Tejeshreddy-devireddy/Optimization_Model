Project 4 â€” Optimization Model (Linear Programming)

Goal: Determine optimal production of two products (A, B) to maximize profit under machine and labor hour constraints.

Method: Used PuLP to model and solve a linear programming problem.

Results:
- Product A units: 33
- Product B units: 33
- Max Profit: 2640

Constraints:
- Max 100 machine hours
- Max 100 labor hours
- A: 1 machine hr, 2 labor hrs
- B: 2 machine hrs, 1 labor hr
